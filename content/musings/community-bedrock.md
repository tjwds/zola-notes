title="what's the new bedrock to make a community?"

This is an idea:

> An online community where professionals in any intersection between technology and literature can come together, share ideas, and solve problems.

Here are some technologies:

* Mailing lists
* Forums
* Newsletters
* Facebook Groups
* Discord Servers
* Slack Groups
* Mastodon Instances
* IRC Channels
* Subreddits
* Lobste.rs-like link-share site
* Blog post comments

None of those technologies feel like a good place to start the community I want to build.

If you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them!  You can reach out to me at joewoods@fastmail.com.
