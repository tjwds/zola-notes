I used to use an app called [Nocturne](https://github.com/nocturneapp/nocturne) to do this on a version of OS X long ago, but now it's just built in to the operating system.

Basically, you want to do two things:

* Enable the color filter, and slam it all the way to one color.  I highly recommend green or red.
* Optional:  enable high-contrast mode.
* Optional:  add the accessibility menu to your menu bar to quickly toggle it on and off.

Why would you want to do this?

* It looks cool.
* Less likely that you'll be distracted — or distracting — when on your laptop in class or at work.
* Higher contrast means you can have your laptop screen be at a lower brightness and still be able to read it.

Unlike Nocturne, the default macOS accessibility setting only acts as a color filter and doesn't really do any color replacement, so out of the box, you're only going to be able to set your monitor to full green, red, or blue.
