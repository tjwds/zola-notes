Well, I went ahead and decided to migrate this little corner of the internet to be using the static site generator [zola](https://getzola.org/).  Though maintaining my own static site generator was fun, I really wanted to make sure this site has an RSS feed, and I just didn't feel like writing that by hand.  Also, by using an existing CI config I already had set up, publishing this site is now as easy as just doing a git commit, and it "just works."

I'm a little sad that I've made some compromises so that I'm not longer actually owning a lot of the infrastructure here, but I think the trade-offs are worth it.  And just because I'm not using a static site generator that I hacked together anymore, doesn't mean that this space is no longer a space I can hack around on!  Probably quite the opposite, really.

Edit 2021-09-23:  Thanks, [Sean](https://github.com/ruleryak), for pointing out an issue with this article!
