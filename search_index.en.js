Today at 8:04 PM\nRun while you still can\nM Today at 8:05 PM\nany pro strats i should know before i start this deck\njoe Today at 8:06 PM\nLet me get back to you once I finish some flashcards ._.\n\nanki pro strats\n\nDon't be afraid to abandon a note.\nDon't be afraid to abandon a deck.\nChange things up if you hit a plateau.  Reduce the number of daily new cards you're getting, or maybe increase them.\nDon't let a \"complete\" deck lapse.  I learned so much about art in 2018, then stopped reviewing the cards once I'd \"finished\" the deck; once I came back to it in 2020, I had to relearn a really large portion of them.  Keep it up!\nYou must do it every day.  Don't let the backlog start to pile up.\nDon't try to add cards you haven't at least been exposed to in some way.  If you're downloading a deck from the internet, go through every card you want to learn from it first.  (Yes, every card.  This may actually more than one day for some decks.)\nAnki compounds very quickly.  Your first few reviews will only take a few minutes.  Don't ramp up to too many cards too quickly.\nStart small and work your way up.  Set a goal, achieve it, then keep climbing.\n20 new cards a day — Anki's default for a deck —&nbsp;is way too much, in my opinion.  You may want to reduce this.\nKeep routines.  Doing your flashcards when you're already exhausted and just want to go to bed is one of the worst feelings in the world.\nSometimes you just won't be in the mindset; you'll start your reviews and things just won't click, or you won't be able to remember things you know you should be able to.  Just take a quick break and come back soon.\nLet Anki take over your life.  Make decks for weird stuff; I have a flashcard for my upstairs neighbor's dog's name so I don't forget.\nI generally compose new cards on desktop and review on mobile, unless something weird is going on.\nSeriously, get the mobile app.  It's worth it.\nThe Android app has a desktop widget that shows you how many cards you have left to review, as well as the amount of time it thinks it'll take you.  Put it on your home screen.\nDo not trust Anki's estimates as to how long things will take you.\nStare at those beautiful graphs.  You made those graphs.  Be proud of those graphs.\n\n\n\njoe Today at 8:28 PM\n\nany pro strats i should know before i start this deck\n\n\n\nM:  https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/anki-advice\nM Today at 8:28 PM\nplugs own blog\njoe Today at 8:28 PM\nExcuse me\nblog.joewoods.dev is my blog\nThat's my wiki\n\n","id":"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/anki-advice/","title":"anki advice"},"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/community-bedrock/":{"body":"This is an idea:\n\nAn online community where professionals in any intersection between technology and literature can come together, share ideas, and solve problems.\n\nHere are some technologies:\n\nMailing lists\nForums\nNewsletters\nFacebook Groups\nDiscord Servers\nSlack Groups\nMastodon Instances\nIRC Channels\nSubreddits\nLobste.rs-like link-share site\nBlog post comments\n\nNone of those technologies feel like a good place to start the community I want to build.\nIf you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them!

(You know, if at all.)  The hope is that by actually looking at this data right in front of me, I can reconcile the differences a little bit and make sure my routines continue to work without effort.\nBut this betrays an interesting question:  how would I write this sort of table in a way that could be shared?\noption one: don't\nHonestly, maybe don't?  If you're running into this problem, is it really a problem to just share a spreadsheet instead?  If you don't have spreadsheet software handy while you're composing this, you could just hand-write a csv and then convert the file name later when you're sharing it.  (I actually do this all the time!)\nSo, as a concrete example, here's what the first few lines would look like in my csv:\n\ntime,planned,reality\n06:30,\"wake up, put away dishes, water pets, stretch, and\nreview my goal for the day\",\"woke up, stared into my\nphone while drinking coffee and trying to wake up\"\n07:00,start my flashcards,still scrolling on my phone\n\nBut you might be in a situation where the closest you could get to a good user experience with this text would be \"okay, now save this text as a CSV and open it in your favorite spreadsheet editor.\"  That doesn't seem to cut it!\noption two:  no, really, don't\nMaybe descriptive text would be better instead?  That way you're conveying the real meaning of the text you're writing, and potentially cutting out extraneous information; those things, combined with a more presentable format, means that your message might have a better chance of coming across the way you want it to.\nAn example:\n\nI woke up at 6:30 a.m.  I have the first half hour after I wake up set aside for small chores, like watering the pets, but instead I don't accomplish anything but staring at my phone.\n\noption three:  a table\nIf you know your text is always going to be read in an environment where the font is fixed width, you can always use a table in your text, but I think it's unlikely that this is going to suit your needs, either.\n| time  | expectation        | reality                  |\n|-------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| 06:30 | wake up, do chores | woke up, stared at phone |\n| 07:00 | do flashcards      | still scrolling          |\nthe real answer:  very long form text\nSo here's what I came up with:\n\nTime: 6:30\nExpectation:  wake up, put away dishes, water pets, stretch, and review my goal for the day\nReality:  woke up, stared into my phone while drinking coffee and trying to wake up\nTime: 7:00\nExpectation:  start my flashcards\nReality:  still staring at phone\n\nClearly, that's going to take up a lot of space. But it definitely meets the requirements.  I think I'll just write the csv by hand instead, though.\n","id":"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/descriptive-data-plain-text/","title":"how to write about descriptive data in plain text"},"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/learning-things-with-youtube/":{"body":"\nAutomotive repair — MONEYPIT, the Miata Build-Along Show with Zach Jobe\nMountain biking — Berm Peak (previously Seth's Bike Hacks) with Seth Alvo\nPlaying go/weiqi/baduk — Nick Sibicky\n\n","id":"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/learning-things-with-youtube/","title":"entertaining youtube channels which make certain topics accessible"},"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/macos-applications/":{"body":"Some macOS applications are well known.

I gave it a drive for about a month or so, attempting to slightly modify my workflow to fit it, but ultimately, I'm going to move back to a slightly modified version of my existing note-taking routine:  VSCode.\nWhen I first checked out Obsidian, I thought, \"sweet, this will help me be more organized without having to really change what I'm doing.\"  Starting up with Obsidian is just as easy as opening the folder full of markdown files that I'm already using.  So, really, other than reading documentation, all I had to do was download it and get started.\nBut this doesn't actually leverage what Obsidian can do for you.  I attempted to reorganize the way that I took notes to some degree, breaking off more projects and landing zones from my daily notes document into their own space.  It didn't really work, though; I ended up with a sort of half-baked zettelkasten that felt all over the place.  The last thing I'd want is for the tool that helps me organize my thoughts to feel unorganized.\nSo, to me, Obsidian felt like it tried to do too many things at once, and not very well.  It's not an \"IDE\"; there are plugins, but they just don't really match what I get out of writing plain markdown in VSCode.  For example, I just opened on of my markdown files that I'd written in Obsidian in VSCode, and immediately saw all of the trailing whitespace that I'd just left hanging around highlighted in bright red.  And, of course, the code snippets I'd embedded in the first file I'd opened had syntax highlighting in them, unlike in Obsidian!\nAlso, I just didn't really feel like I needed Yet Another Electron Application open to take notes.  Switching between writing notes and writing code should not be distracting — doing so with VSCode is, in my mind, seamless.  Switching between Obsidian and VSCode still always required a context switch for me.\nThe other benefits I thought Obsidian could have brought to the table just didn't work out for me, either.  Obsidian has a unified aesthetic, and seen from far away, it is quite pretty.  But that got stale for me pretty fast, and I found myself again preferring my hyper-personalized VSCode setup.  I found the places where Obsidian took over and formatted your markdown for you just not worth it — I guess I just prefer headers to be boldly highlighted, but not actually bigger when I'm writing documents.  At the end of the day, I just found my VSCode theme more delightful to look at.  I even tried theming Obsidian, but it still just couldn't hold up.\nThere are very many valid complaints to be made about Microsoft, but VSCode is licensed under MIT.  Microsoft seems to have found shepherding this editor that I really, really like profitable, but maybe a lot of that is because they're big name players that can afford to give the project the attention it deserves.  Obsidian is closed-source, and though the way they seek to gain a profit off the editor isn't creepy yet, I could see it easily growing that way.\nConcrete UI complaints\nSo:  that was a lot of abstract complaints, but there were quite a few day-to-day UI quirks about Obsidian that made me quit it.  Some of these are just an artifact of my having gained muscle memory for one editor and then attempting to switch to another, but others, I think, are valid complaints, and even those that are clearly a me problem could be resolved by letting things be a little more configurable.\nI just don't get the way that changing between files works\nI could not wrap my head around pressing ⌘O to bring up the file switcher, but this is probably because Obsidian's \"action\" command pallet shortcut is ⌘P, which is subtly different from VSCode, where the command pallet is in \"file\" mode on ⌘P and \"action\" mode with ⌘⇧P (or, my preferred ⌘P then typing &gt;).  I know that this is mostly a me problem, but this seems like a pretty hard break from the way any other editor does things.\nNew files\nI kept pressing ⌘N to create a new file and ⌘V to dump my clipboard buffer in one single action, because this is muscle memory for me at this point, but if you do this in Obsidian, you'll end up with your paste buffer as the file name, and you can't just ⌘A to select and delete your mistake, because you can't ⌘A within the title.\nFolders\nFolder support in Obsidian is not great.  You can either have all new files be created at the top level, or be put into the same directory as the file you just had open (?!).  This means that I was just constantly losing files, turning to my terminal to try to find where the heck the file actually went.  VSCode's file browser does this pretty great thing where it'll focus the file location in the file explorer when you focus on a file in your editor; it seems to me the Obsidian must get this feature in order for me to be able to actually use it.  Trying to find a file among many, many folders all containing many, many files was infinitely frustrating.\nVSCode's just better about workspaces and opening files\nI am constantly reaching for the terminal command open ..  As far as I know, you can't do that with Obsidian; nor is it really designed for opening arbitrary files to edit outside of the context of a project.\nI have a lot of workspace-specific configurations in VSCode, like the extension Peacock, which allows me to say, mark an editor as the bright blue \"this is the active repository\" editor so that I can very easily distinguish it from a reference repository I have open.  Yeah, I have multiple checkouts of a few projects, I know, I know.\nEditing often feels clunky\nWriting just didn't feel like a pleasant experience to me with Obsidian.  I honestly don't have a lot of concrete data to point to why, it just didn't feel good!\nThe only actual issue I can remember is the frustrating ambiguity as to what an asterisk is about to do in markdown.  I make a lot of unordered lists when organizing projects, notes, or just writing about things — this article, for example, was written in my typical writing style of having a big ol' unordered list at the bottom that I slowly turned into paragraphs.\nWrapping something in asterisks in markdown creates emphasis, though, so Obsidian will add another asterisk after your current cursor location when you type one.  But, if your line starts with an asterisk and you press enter, Obsidian will create a new line for you that starts with an asterisk.\nMaybe this is the behavior that other people want, but it often broke my flow as I was writing.\nPanes and tabs\nI also just found the pane model frustrating.  Obsidian (as far as I know) doesn't support tabs, which means in order to open another file, it must be in another pane, or it'll close the editor you had open in order to open the new file.  To keep a file open, you can pin it, and then opening a new file will create a new split pane, which is kind of nice, but again, I just prefer the way that VSCode does it.\nOrganization\nI'd prefer if Obsidian didn't keep around empty files with the title \"Untitled\" — I would often find myself opening and then closing a new file, so at the end of the day, I'd have at least one completely empty \"Untitled.md\" file to delete from my notes.\nOther thoughts\n\nVSCode and git go hand-in-hand, and I like using git to back up and see how my notes have changed over time.  VSCode makes unstaged changes very visible, whereas Obsidian doesn't!\n\n","id":"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/on-obsidian/","title":"on obsidian.md"},"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/wyoming/":{"body":"•&nbsp;many leftists might take objection to electoralism, but if you play the game to the same degree that the right-wing parties in the US have, it becomes clear how relatively easy it is to warp this system to support Leftist goals\n","id":"https://notes.joewoods.dev/musings/wyoming/","title":"A Modest Proposal to Start a Commune in Wyoming"},"https://notes.joewoods.dev/projects/":{"body":"information about projects\n","id":"https://notes.joewoods.dev/projects/","title":"projects"},"https://notes.joewoods.dev/projects/wordpress-thumbnails/":{"body":"Man, this was a frustrating thing to figure out.
